# Simon-Game
The HTML/CSS/JS Simon game replicates the classic memory challenge with four colored buttons: red, green, blue, and yellow. Players repeat the displayed sequence, with difficulty increasing over time. Scores are tracked as players aim to repeat sequences accurately, enhancing memory and pattern recognition skills.
